The project was created by my university colleagues and I. This project is supposed to help Greek students study for their final History exam. It gives them the 
opporunity to study the specific chapters from their subject matter and take multiple choice tests. Afterwards, the students can check their answers and see which 
chapter they need to study more. Also , you can see from the .PNG files how the project works in general. From the main menu you can choose 1)to study , by clicking the 
chapters button ("Ενότητες") and the choose which chapter you wish to study , 2) to start the exam , by clicking the start exam button ("Έναρξη Τεστ") and then
you can choose which chapter you want to be examined at, 3) to see the statistics of the exams taken , by clicking the statistics button ("Στατιστικά") and 4) to delete 
all the statistics that are saved in the statistics file, by clicking the delete statistics button("Καθ. Στατ.", "Καθαρισμός Στατιστικών"). 
P.S. Many files are written in greek(e.g. manual , handbook , the history chapters , the exam questions and answers , the names of the .PNG files) because the project 
focuses on helping the Greek students to learn.
